# A Collection of VideoPaks for the OP-Z

There are two VideoPaks available:\
-a version of the tombola sequencer from the OP-1\
-a touchscreen XY pad that sends MIDI out via the OP-Z

# How To Use

# Tombola:
Knob functions 1-4 are labeled on screen at startup, tap the "UI PAGE" text to see knob functions 5-8.\
Tap the text again to go back to the first page.

# XYPak:
XYpad sends MIDI CC to knobs 1 and 2, fader 1 sends MIDI CC to knob 3, and fader 2 sends MIDI CC to knob 4.\
Knobs 7 and 8 control the gyro sensitivity.\
Tap the top left corner of the screen to access the sensitivity values for the gyro.\
I found them useful to have, but not very nice to look at, so they're hidden by default.

# Known Bugs:
Due to a UI bug that I'm not sure how to fix, you have to tap the videopak name twice to exit.
