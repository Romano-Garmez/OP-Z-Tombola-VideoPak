# A Collection of VideoPaks for the OP-Z

Currently there are two videopaks available:\
-a version of the tombola sequencer from the OP-1\
-a touchscreen xy pad that sends midi out via the OP-Z

# How To Use

# Tombola:
Knob functions 1-4 are labeled on screen at startup, tap the "UI PAGE" text to see knob functions 5-8. tap the text again to go back to the first page. Due to a ui bug that I'm not sure how to fix, you have to tap the videopak name twice to exit.

# XYPak:
XYpad sends midi cc to knobs 1 and 2, fader 1 sends midi cc to knob 3, and fader 2 sends midi cc to knob 4. Knobs 7 and 8 control the gyro sensitivity. Tap the top left corner of the screen to access the sensitivity values for the gyro. I found them useful to have, but not very nice to look at, so they're hidden by default. Due to a ui bug that I'm not sure how to fix, you have to tap the videopak name twice to exit.
